Project Overview:
The ASL Sign Language Detection project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying and classifying American Sign Language (ASL) gestures from image data captured using a laptop camera. The ultimate goal is to facilitate real-time communication for individuals with hearing impairments.

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Data Collection: Images for the dataset were captured using a laptop camera. Various ASL signs were performed and recorded to create a diverse dataset.
Data Preprocessing: The dataset underwent preprocessing tasks to ensure quality and consistency. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting any inconsistencies in the collected images.
Feature Engineering:

Feature Extraction: New features were engineered from the image data, including aspects such as hand gestures, hand positions, and movement patterns indicative of ASL signs.
Feature Selection: Relevant features were selected based on their significance in detecting ASL signs.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Statistical Analysis: Statistical techniques were applied to understand the distribution of ASL signs in the dataset and identify any outliers.
Visualization: Visualizations using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn were created to explore relationships between image features and ASL signs.
Model Building:

Model Selection: Various machine learning algorithms, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), were experimented with to find the most suitable model for ASL sign detection.
Model Training: The dataset was split into training and testing sets. The model was trained using VS Code, leveraging its integrated development environment for Python and machine learning.
Model Evaluation: The trained models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess their performance in ASL sign detection.
Deployment:

Development Environment: The project was developed using VS Code, providing a robust environment for coding, debugging, and version control.
Version Control: The project is hosted on GitHub, providing accessibility for others to explore the code, reproduce the findings, and contribute to further enhancements.
Future Deployment: Plans include optimizing the models through hyperparameter tuning and deploying the trained model as a web service or integrating it into a real-time ASL communication application.
