# ASL Sign Language Detection

**Project Overview:**
The ASL Sign Language Detection project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying and classifying American Sign Language (ASL) gestures from image data captured using a laptop camera. The ultimate goal is to facilitate real-time communication for individuals with hearing impairments.

**Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
1. Data Collection: Images for the dataset were captured using a laptop camera. Various ASL signs were performed and recorded to create a diverse dataset.
2. Data Preprocessing: The dataset underwent preprocessing tasks to ensure quality and consistency. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting any inconsistencies in the collected images.

**Feature Engineering:**
1. Feature Extraction: New features were engineered from the image data, including aspects such as hand gestures, hand positions, and movement patterns indicative of ASL signs.
2. Feature Selection: Relevant features were selected based on their significance in detecting ASL signs.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
1. Statistical Analysis: Statistical techniques were applied to understand the distribution of ASL signs in the dataset and identify any outliers.
2. Visualization: Visualizations using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn were created to explore relationships between image features and ASL signs.

**Model Building:**
1. Model Selection: Various machine learning algorithms, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), were experimented with to find the most suitable model for ASL sign detection.
2. Model Training: The dataset was split into training and testing sets. The model was trained using VS Code, leveraging its integrated development environment for Python and machine learning.
3. Model Evaluation: The trained models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess their performance in ASL sign detection.

**Deployment:**
1. Development Environment: The project was developed using VS Code, providing a robust environment for coding, debugging, and version control.
2. Version Control: The project is hosted on GitHub, providing accessibility for others to explore the code, reproduce the findings, and contribute to further enhancements.
3. Future Deployment: Plans include optimizing the models through hyperparameter tuning and deploying the trained model as a web service or integrating it into a real-time ASL communication application.
